                        <p>This job involved making drinks for customers. I washed dishes, and maintained a clean work area. I also did other jobs around the store.

This job taught me how to always be amicable and it taught me how to make things right despite when customers got irritable. And of course I enjoyed the happy customers. I think this job made me much more well rounded and taught me some social skills that are invaluable.                        </p>
